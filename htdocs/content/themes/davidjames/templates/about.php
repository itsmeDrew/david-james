        David James is the author of Steps, his debut novel.
      </p>
      <p class="about-content__paragraph">
        Born to a country family in the spring of 1950, James spent most of his foundational years as a ranchhand in west Texas. While growing up as a cowboy, he developed a unique passion for art and literature. A lifelong painter, James has worked professionally as an artist for over forty years.
      </p>
      <p class="about-content__paragraph">
        Unsatisfied with life in the country, James left west Texas to travel and live throughout the world — mostly out of a backpack. Having considered himself fortunate for his experiences, he now sees himself as a communicator and teacher rather than an artist or writer. Although he is certainly also those things.
      </p>
      <p class="about-content__paragraph">
        With no formal education, James’ artistic training stems from a deep appreciation of the works of Van Gogh, Gauguin and Cezanne, as well as the literature of D.H. Lawrence, Gertrude Stein and John Steinbeck, among others.
      </p>
      <p class="about-content__paragraph">
        James’ debut novel, Steps, tells a story of redemption and new beginnings — something he has been forced to experience more than once.
      </p>
      <p class="about-content__paragraph">
        Today, James lives in Austin, Texas with his wife and son.

            <p>Over the past decade, buyers have drastically transformed how they make purchase decisions. By some estimates, even 80 percent of B2B purchase cycles are completed before the buyer contacts sales. That's where inbound marketing comes in. By creating relevant and high-quality content, and then distributing that content through various online channels, inbound marketing can produce more than 50% more leads than traditional marketing practices.</p>
